# Analytics & Weekly Reports Guide

## üìä How Analytics Work in BiteHeist

BiteHeist tracks restaurant performance over time by storing **snapshots** of data in MongoDB. This allows you to see trends, improvements, and competitor movements.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: MongoDB Required

**All analytics features require MongoDB to be running!**

Without MongoDB:
- ‚ùå No weekly reports
- ‚ùå No ranking history
- ‚ùå No competitor tracking
- ‚ùå No trend analysis

**With MongoDB:**
- ‚úÖ Track rankings over weeks/months
- ‚úÖ Generate weekly performance reports
- ‚úÖ Monitor competitor movements
- ‚úÖ Analyze traffic trends
- ‚úÖ Calculate revenue impact over time

## üöÄ Quick Start: Enable Analytics

### Step 1: Install MongoDB

**Windows:**
```bash
# Download from: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community
# Or use Chocolatey:
choco install mongodb

# Start MongoDB
mongod
```

**Mac:**
```bash
brew tap mongodb/brew
brew install mongodb-community
brew services start mongodb-community
```

**Linux:**
```bash
sudo apt-get install mongodb
sudo systemctl start mongod
```

### Step 2: Verify MongoDB is Running

```bash
# Check if MongoDB is running
mongosh

# Or check the backend logs - you should NOT see:
# "‚ùå MongoDB connection failed"
```

### Step 3: Run Your First Audit

Once MongoDB is running:

1. **Search for a restaurant**
2. **Click "Run Audit"**
3. **Data is automatically saved to MongoDB**

The audit saves:
- Restaurant details
- Ranking snapshot
- Competitor snapshot
- Performance metrics

### No Weekly Reports Showing

**Problem:** Not enough data collected

**Solution:**
- Run at least 2 audits (1 week apart)
- Weekly reports need historical data to compare
- First audit = baseline, second audit = first report

### Competitor Data Empty

**Problem:** No competitors found nearby

**Solution:**
- Make sure restaurant has a location (lat/lng)
- Increase search radius in code (default 1km)
