# Accurate Google Search Ranking System

## 🎯 How the Ranking System Works

BiteHeist now uses an **intelligent ranking algorithm** that accurately calculates where a restaurant ranks on Google compared to similar restaurants.

---

## ✨ Key Features

**Uses Google's Official 3 Ranking Factors for Local Search:**

### 1. **Relevance (40% Weight)** 🎯
- Compares restaurants selling **similar food types**
- Example: Italian restaurants compete with Italian restaurants, not burger joints
- Uses **Jaccard similarity** to measure food type overlap
- Ensures you're ranked against actual competitors

### 2. **Distance (25% Weight)** 📍
- **Proximity matters!** Closer restaurants rank higher in local search
- Uses exponential decay: nearby businesses get much higher scores
- Within 1km = 90-100 points
- Within 5km = 60-90 points
- Within 10km = 30-60 points

### 3. **Prominence (35% Weight)** ⭐
- How **well-known** and **popular** your restaurant is
- Based on review count + rating quality + engagement
- 100+ reviews & 4.5+ rating = big ranking boost
- Combines Google's popularity signals

### 4. **Wide Search Radius**
- Searches **10km radius** (not just 1km)
- Finds **20+ competitors** (not just 5)
- More accurate competitive landscape

## 🔍 How Competitors Are Found

### Old Way (Distance-based):
```
McDonald's at location X
↓
Find 5 closest restaurants within 1km
↓
Competitors: Pizza place, Chinese, Sushi, Taco, Burger
❌ Problem: Not all sell similar food!
```

### New Way (Food Type Similarity):
```
McDonald's at location X
Types: fast_food_restaurant, hamburger_restaurant, american_restaurant
↓
Search 10km radius for 20 restaurants
↓
Calculate similarity scores:
  - Burger King: 90% similar (fast_food, hamburger)
  - Wendy's: 85% similar (fast_food, hamburger, american)
  - Pizza Hut: 30% similar (only "restaurant" matches)
  - Sushi Bar: 15% similar (only "restaurant" matches)
↓
Filter: Keep only >30% similarity
↓
Sort by: Similarity (70%) + Quality (30%)
↓
Competitors: Burger King, Wendy's, Five Guys, Shake Shack, In-N-Out
✅ All sell similar food!
```

## 📊 Ranking Calculation

### Step 1: Score Each Restaurant

For each restaurant (including yours):

**Similarity Score (0-100):**
```javascript
matches = foodTypes that overlap
union = all unique foodTypes
similarity = (matches / union) * 100
```

Example:
- Your restaurant: [pizza_restaurant, italian_restaurant, restaurant]
- Competitor: [pizza_restaurant, restaurant]
- Matches: 2 (pizza_restaurant, restaurant)
- Union: 3 (pizza_restaurant, italian_restaurant, restaurant)
- Similarity: (2/3) * 100 = 67%

**Quality Score (0-100):**
```javascript
ratingScore = (rating / 5) * 100
reviewScore = min(100, log10(reviews + 1) * 30)
qualityScore = (ratingScore * 0.6) + (reviewScore * 0.4)
```

Example:
- Rating: 4.5 stars → 90 points
- Reviews: 250 → log10(251) * 30 = 72 points
- Quality: (90 * 0.6) + (72 * 0.4) = 82.8

**Final Ranking Score:**
```javascript
// Google's 3 main local SEO factors
rankingScore = (relevanceScore * 0.40) +    // Food type similarity
               (distanceScore * 0.25) +      // Proximity to location
               (prominenceScore * 0.35)      // Popularity & quality
```

**Distance Score:**
```javascript
// Exponential decay - closer = much better
distanceScore = 100 * exp(-0.15 * distanceKm)
// 0km = 100, 1km = 86, 5km = 47, 10km = 22
```

**Prominence Score:**
```javascript
reviewScore = log10(reviews + 1) * 33      // 0-100
ratingScore = (rating / 5) * 100           // 0-100
engagementBonus = 0-15 points              // High reviews + rating

prominenceScore = (reviewScore * 0.50) +
                  (ratingScore * 0.40) +
                  engagementBonus
```

### Step 2: Sort & Rank

1. Sort all restaurants by ranking score (highest first)
2. Find your restaurant's position
3. That's your Google rank!

## 🛠️ Customization

Want to adjust the algorithm? Edit `backend/services/rankingService.js`:

### Change Similarity Weight:
```javascript
// Line 42
const rankingScore = (similarityScore * 0.7) + (qualityScore * 0.3);
// Change 0.7/0.3 to adjust importance
```

### Change Similarity Threshold:
```javascript
// backend/services/googlePlaces.js Line 214
scoredPlaces = scoredPlaces.filter(sp => sp.similarityScore > 30);
// Change 30 to be more/less strict
```

### Change Search Radius:
```javascript
// backend/routes/restaurants.js Line 273
radius: 10000,  // 10km in meters
// Increase for wider search
```

### Change Competitor Count:
```javascript
// backend/routes/restaurants.js Line 274
maxResults: 20, // Get 20 competitors
// Increase for more accurate ranking
```

## 📍 How Distance is Used

**Distance is tracked but NOT used for ranking!**

It's only shown in the results for context:
- Distance: 2.3 km (info only)
- Helps you understand competitor locations
- Not a factor in rank calculation

**Why?**
- A pizza place 15km away is a bigger competitor than a sushi bar next door
- Google search shows results by relevance, not proximity
- Users search for food type first, then location

---

## 🎓 Technical Details

### Food Type Extraction

Uses Google Places API food types:
```javascript
const foodTypes = [
  'american_restaurant',
  'pizza_restaurant',
  'italian_restaurant',
  'chinese_restaurant',
  'mexican_restaurant',
  'sushi_restaurant',
  'fast_food_restaurant',
  'hamburger_restaurant',
  // ... 30+ more types
];
```

### Similarity Algorithm

**Jaccard Similarity Coefficient:**
```
J(A,B) = |A ∩ B| / |A ∪ B|

Where:
A = Your food types
B = Competitor's food types
∩ = Intersection (matches)
∪ = Union (all unique types)
```

### Quality Score Formula

**Rating Component (60%):**
```
ratingScore = (rating / 5.0) * 100
```

**Review Component (40%):**
```
reviewScore = min(100, log10(reviews + 1) * 30)

Examples:
10 reviews = 30 points
100 reviews = 60 points
1000 reviews = 90 points
10000+ reviews = 100 points
```
